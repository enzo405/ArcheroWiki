## How to Contribute

### Forking and Pull Requests

1. **Fork the Repository**: Users can create a copy of this repository under their own GitHub account by clicking the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page. This allows you to make changes in your forked repository.

2. **Create Branches**: After forking, create new branches in your forked repository to work on new features or changes. Use the `feature/*` branch model, and ensure your branch name clearly describes the work you are doing.

3. **Submit Pull Requests**: Once your changes are ready, submit a pull request from your forked repository to this repository. When submitting a pull request, provide a clear and concise description (one or two sentences) of what you are adding or updating in the wiki. This helps maintainers quickly understand your contribution.
